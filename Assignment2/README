CTFiducials.m
Main script for the project that outputs the coordinates of the CT fiducials

calculateBezierCoeff.m
Calculate the C_estimate values and uses Bernstein polynomials to calculate 
the coefficients that will be used to correct future distortions

distortionFunction.m
Function that takes in two data sets and computes the correction coefficients

correctDistortion.m
Function that takes the correction coefficients and distorted data and outputs
the corrected version of the data

emPivotCalibrationCorrected.m
Similar to assignment 1. Calculates relative tip location and reference frame 
of the probe.

scaleToBox.m 
Function that scales a data set to a 1x1x1 cube

unscaleFromBox.m
Function that undoes the scaling function

Operating instructions: Running CTFiducials.m should perform all tasks
