main_pa5.m
Test our program by running this script. The data set is changed by
modifying a variable called 'run'. The text in this variable will be
placed in the filename in the following form (with the file path): 
['PA5-',run,'-SampleReadingsTest.txt']
i.e. run = 'A-debug'  OR  run = 'K-Unknown'

deformMesh.m
Function that deforms a mesh based on trying to match up to a set of points

meshToBary.m
Calculates mode values of a mesh based on barycentric coordinates of the 
point on the old mesh

updateWeights.m
Update the weights of each mode based on the mode values calculated 
in the previous function

updateMesh.m
Update the mesh based on the mode weights calculated in the previous
function

getDisplacements.m
Helper function to extract the displacements from a file, skipping the
comment line in the file

icp.m
Function that iteratively matches a set of points to a mesh

findClosestPtOnMesh.m
Matches a set of points to their closest neighbors on the mesh

findClosestPtOnTri.m
Given a triangle (3 vertices) and a point, finds the point on the 
triangle closest to the given point

Helper functions include:
transform.m
ptCloudPtCloud.m
projectOntoVector.m
invTransformation.m
getTriangles.m
getCoordinates.m
